# Lumerical-simulations-for-cluster
FDTD simulation files (computed with the software Lumerical) and result analysis scripts (Matlab) on controlled disorder in rectangular reflection gratings. Different levels of disorder were generated and analysed. The simulation files in this repository were designed to run on a computer cluster.
